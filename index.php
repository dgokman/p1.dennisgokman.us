   <h1>Dennis Gokman</h1>
      <p>Hello All. I am 30 years old and work in mobile advertising. I grew up in suburban NYC and moved to Boston 3 years ago to further my career. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, playing basketball, and eating ice cream. I am currently wrapped up in the TV show 'Breaking Bad' and cannot wait to see how it ends. I am hoping to leverage this class and others in order to transition into development at my company</p>
